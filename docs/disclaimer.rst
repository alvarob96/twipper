==========

This package has been created in order to cover Premium Twipper API functions since `tweepy <https://www.tweepy.org/>`_,
the most used Python package working as a Twitter API wrapper. Anyways, `twipper <https://github.com/alvarob96/twipper>`_
also covers both Free and Premium functions, which include batch processing and stream processing.

Conclude that this is the result of a research project, so this package has been developed with research purposes and
no profit is intended.
